/**
 * Defines a factory which can return an Object instance

 * <p>This interface is typically used to encapsulate a generic factory which
 * returns a new instance (prototype) of some target object on each invocation.
 *
 * <p>This interface is similar to {@link FactoryBean}, but implementations
 * of the latter are normally meant to be defined as SPI instances in a
 * {@link BeanFactory}, while implementations of this class are normally meant
 * to be fed as an API to other beans (through injection). As such, the
 * {@code getObject()} method has different exception handling behavior.
